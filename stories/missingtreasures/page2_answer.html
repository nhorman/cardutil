        The Amber Room was a testament to artistry and craftsmanship,
        not to mention the wealth of the Russian Tsars family.&nbsp;
        Find this treasure today, and you will be quite wealthy.&nbsp;
        Don't spend to much time on it though, as its largely thought to
        have been destroyed.<br>
