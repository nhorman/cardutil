    <h1 align="center">Coincidental Death?</h1>
    <p>Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams, bothers in arms during the
      revolution, found themselves on opposite sides of the
      Republican/Federalist divide during the early years of the United
      States, and reconciled when Jefferson sent Adams a new years
      greeting on Jan 1, 1812.&nbsp; This started a 15 year letter
      exchange between the two men in which they rekindled their
      friendship, until their almost tandem deaths on July 4, 1826.<br>
