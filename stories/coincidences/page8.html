    <p>$ANSWER1 had an adventurous life that she didn't particularly ask
      for.&nbsp; In an effort to take care of her ailing mother, she
      took a job as a stewardess on the White Star line of ships in
      England in 1911, serving initially on the $ANSWER2.&nbsp; In
      September of that year when the ship collided with the HMS Hawke
      near the Isle of Wight, sinking.&nbsp; $ANSWER1 saved several
      lives during that sinking, and then went on to serve on an other
      White Star owned ship....the $ANSWER3.&nbsp; She was on its maiden
      voyage in 1912, making a transatlantic crossing, when the ship
      famously collided with an iceberg, sinking.&nbsp; Many lives were
      lost, but not $ANSWER1's.&nbsp; She managed to help several women
      and children into lifeboats, including herself.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Not content with two sinkings, $ANSWER1 decided to enter the
      nursing field, and took a position on the $ANSWER4 with the
      British Red Cross.&nbsp; In 1916 the $ANSWER4 struck a German mine
      in the Aegean Sea.&nbsp; The ship sunk, but not $ANSWER1, who
      again survived, and saved many others with her.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>$ANSWER1 went on to continue working on cruise ships spanning a
      42 year career at sea.<br>
