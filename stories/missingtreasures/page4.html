    <h1 align="center">Looking for Aztec Treasure</h1>
    <p><br>
      In 1519, Spanish Conquistador $ANSWER1 arrived in what is modern
      day Mexico, exploring for the Spanish.&nbsp; Upon arrival, they
      were greeted by the Aztec people, led by Emperor $ANSWER2.&nbsp;
      $ANSWER2 greeted the Spaniards with reverence, and showered them
      with gold and silver, hoping to appease the newcomers, so that
      they would leave their city of Tenochtitlan in peace.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.&nbsp; The Spanish
      placed $ANSWER2 under arrest, and ransacked the city in the hopes
      of finding additional riches.&nbsp; Rising in rebellion, the Aztec
      people fought back, causing the Spanish forces to flee with what
      treasure they had acquired.&nbsp; In an effort to hasten their
      escape, the Spanish dumped their treasure in $ANSWER3.&nbsp;
      $ANSWER1 spent the following year rebuilding his army, at which
      point he returned to Tenochtitlan, and conquered the Aztecs
      permanently.&nbsp; However, the treasure that was abandoned in
      $ANSWER3 was never recovered.<br>
