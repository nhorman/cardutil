    <h1 align="center">The Great Missing Box</h1>
    <p>According to the Bible, God instructed Moses to create a gold
      covered wooden chest with a lid to house the two stone tablets of
      the Ten Commandments.&nbsp; This box, known as the $ANSWER1, was
      carried by the Israelites in the desert for 40 years, after their
      exodus from Egypt, eventually finding a home in the Temple of
      Solomon.&nbsp; Years later, during their war against the
      Philistines, the $ANSWER1 was lost.&nbsp; While several claims
      have been made as to its current location, including Mount Nebo,
      Ethiopia, and Rome, France, and Ireland, its true location has
      never again been verified.<br>
