    <p><br>
      During late 1864, #ANSWER1 was traveling from New York to
      Washington, DC. While the train was stopped in Jersey City, he
      leaned against the stopped train, which suddenly began to move. He
      would have been seriously injured or killed, had it not been for
      the quick reaction of #ANSWER2. Whats amazing was that #ANSWER1's
      rescuer was none other than #ANSWER3, famous stage actor, and
      brother to #ANSWER4, who in turn was the assasin of #ANSWER5, who
      was also the father of #ANSWER1! </p>
